Welcome to the CCP555 repository! Follow the steps below to get started:

## Starting the Server

To start the server using Node.js, run the following command:

```bash
node /src/server.js
```

Alternatively, you can use the provided script to start the server:

```bash
npm start
```

If you want to use nodemon for active file monitoring and automatic server restarts on file changes, use the following command:

```bash
npm run dev
```

## Debugging

To connect a debugger to your running process, you can use the following command:

```bash
npm run debug
```

## Code Quality Check

To check for errors in your code or to get visual indicators for issues, run the following command for linting:

```bash
npm run lint
```

Once the server is running, it will be available locally at port 8080. You can access your application by opening a web browser and navigating to http://localhost:8080.
